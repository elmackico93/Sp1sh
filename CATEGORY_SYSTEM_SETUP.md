# Category System Upgrade Instructions

This document provides instructions for setting up the new category system.

## Files Modified

The following files were created or modified by the upgrade script:

1. New TypeScript definitions in `types/categories.ts`
2. New utility functions in `utils/categories/categoryUtils.ts`
3. Enhanced navigation context in `context/NavigationContext.tsx`
4. Dynamic route handler in `pages/categories/[...slug].tsx`
5. Category index redirectors in all category subdirectories
6. New Emergency dynamic route handler in `pages/emergency/[...slug].tsx`
7. Emergency subdirectory index files

## Post-Installation Steps

After running the script, you should:

1. Start your development server with `npm run dev`
2. Test the category routes using the provided test script `./test-category-routes.sh`
3. Verify that all category pages load correctly
4. Check that breadcrumbs are displaying properly
5. Test filtering functionality on category pages

## Common Issues

If you encounter issues with the new system:

1. Make sure the `navigationMenu` array in `components/layout/EnhancedNavbar.tsx` is properly exported
2. Check for typing errors in the navigation structure
3. Verify that your content fetching logic in `ScriptsContext.tsx` is working properly
4. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
